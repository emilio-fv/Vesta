## General Info
- This project is a part of my current software developer portfolio. The inspiration for this project was to recreate a user experience most people are familiar with - online shopping. I specifically designed this application for a smaller scale fashion designer that could use this to promote their products online, which includes access an admin portal where the inventory of products can be managed directly.
